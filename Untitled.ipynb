    "We have been tasked with creating a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on the data set provided on power production taken from Moodle. The goal is to produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set. We must then develop a web service that will respond with predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests. "
